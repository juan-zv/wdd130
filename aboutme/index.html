  <h2>Juan Zurita</h2>
  <p>My name is Juan Zurita and I'm from Bolivia. I am studying Applied Technology 
    because I really enjoy computers and everything related with technology. </p> 
  <p>I am the youngest of 3 sibilings and the one that is still single. I am not 
    working yet but I want to learn programming languages in order to have better opportunities.</p>
  <p>I am pursuing a BS because I think this would help my curriculum. The thing I love the most
     about BYU is the spiritual emphasis and how I can academically and spiritually grow here.</p>
  <p>I have been a member of the church since I was 9 and I served a mission in Bolivia. My favorite 
    scripture is in D&C 121:7-8 which helped me a lot during several experiences I have had.</p>
  <P>A favorite quote I have from Dieter F. Uchtdorf that says: "My dear friends, my beloved brothers 
    and sisters, God will watch over and shepherd you during these times of uncertainty and fear. He knows you.
     He hears your pleas. He is faithful and dependable. He will fulfill His promises." 
     It is from the october 2020 General Conference but I really feel these words deep in my heart until today.</p>
