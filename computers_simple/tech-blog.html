                <p class="tech-blog-solution">
                The most common problems may be due to overused displays. I recommend you change your screen. Before thinking that you should check if the problem isn't related to the drivers or software installed in the PC. Go to your graphics adapter manufacturer web page and try to manually install the graphic driver. That should be an executable package (file).

                <h1 class="tech-blog-concern">"My PC is really slow."
                <p class="tech-blog-solution">
                    This issue has to do with your hardware(most likely). As your computer gets older, problems like these may be worse. When having these problems, the easiest solution may be to buy a new computer. You can still save your data though. If you update components or buy a new device, there are several tools to make backups and restore your information and lastly I can write down a simple tutorial for you to change your Hard Disk.

                <h1 class="tech-blog-concern">"My PC Will Not Turn On"
                <p class="tech-blog-solution">
                    Pressing the power button on your computer and having nothing happen can feel like the end of the world. Luckily, power issues do not necessarily mean the entire PC is broken or that data has been lost. Both desktops and laptops can refuse to turn on for a number of reasons. Sometimes it can even be just a peripheral such as an external monitor that is having problems and stopping the PC from turning on entirely.

            <div class="tech-blog-div">
                <h1 class="tech-blog-concern">"I have a blue screen displaying."
                <p class="tech-blog-solution">
                    Commonly, there is an error code associated with a blue screen, so you should try to write that information down when possible. If it is a more severe issue, IT professionals can use those codes to help diagnose and repair your computer more efficiently.
                    When software issues cause blue screens, the first thing you should do is let the system turn off and try to reboot on its own. Modern computers have functions and features that will automatically attempt to repair these issues. Sometimes a simple restart and wait could fix random blue screens.
