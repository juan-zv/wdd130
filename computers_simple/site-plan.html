        PCs are essentially a machine that makes our lives easier through apps and programs.
        It allows us to be connected to the web and achieve many things, as scheduling appointments for various services via the web.
        Computers have an unlimitted library of data and that is knowledge if it is correctly used. Depending on our PC build we can do simple tasks from just surfing the web to shape and 
        share our awesome ideas.
        Every computer is made up of two important things: hardware and software.
        Hardware is all the physical parts that a computer is built from, and is what makes a computer useful.
        Hardware are the physical components you can touch, and they are located on both the outside and the inside of a computer.
        These are also the parts that perform all the operations and execute instructions.
        Software is made up of all the digital parts - the components you cannot see or touch in a computer.
        Software are collections of programs that tell the hardware components what to do and how to behave. They give the hardware the instructions it needs to execute in order to get things done.
        Programs are a set of instructions in the form of 0s and 1s (or binary code). They are commands that need to be executed in sequential, logical order.
        The basic hardware and software of a computer
        Some of the hardware components you can find on the outside of a computer are:
        The computer case, also known as the tower, which contains the important hardware pieces that are found on the inside of a computer. This external physical part stores the internal circuits and digital structures of a computer.
        Output devices such as:
        A monitor, which is a screen, used for displaying and outputting visual information.
        A set of speakers, which translate digital signals to sound.
        A printer, which outputs information on pieces of paper.
        Input devices such as:
        A keyboard used for typing text and characters – essentially for entering any written information.
        A mouse for clicking, pointing, and selecting approriate data.
        A microphone.
        Some of the most important internal pieces of hardware are mentioned below:
        The motherboard. It's the main circuit board which connects all the important hardware components together.
        The CPU (short for Central Processing Unit). Every computer has a CPU. It is also known as a processor and is often referred to as the 'brain' of a computer, since it processes large amounts of information at a high speed. It carries out arithmetic and logical functions.
        The GPU (short for Graphics Processing Unit). It renders and manipulates images, graphics, videos, and all kinds of visual data.
        RAM ( short for Random Access Memory), or the main memory. It's a volatile, short-term type of memory that only stores information temporarily while a computer is powered by electricity. It is used when you open and are using an application or file. When the power turns off, any files you created or updates you made and didn't save will be lost and are hard to retrieve.
        HDD (short for Hard Disk Drive) and SSD (short for Solid State Drive), are storage devices and are non-volatile. This means that they store and save data permanently, even when the computer is shut down and there is no power supply.
        A power supply unit. All components require electricity in order to operate and function correctly. The power supply connects to some type of power source, whether it's a power outlet or a battery.
        Some important software components are packages that contain programs for word and number processing and giving presentations such as the Microsoft Office Suite.

        "I have a problem with my display."
        The most common problems may be due to overused displays. I recommend you change your screen.
        Before thinking that you should check if the problem isn't related to the drivers or software installed in the PC.
        Go to your graphics adapter manufacturer web page and try to manually install the graphic driver.
        That should be an executable package (file)...

        "My PC is reallt slow."
        This issue has to do with your hardware(most likely). As your computer gets older, problems like these may be worse. When having these problems,
        the easiest solution may be to buy a new computer. You can still save your data though. If you update components or buy a new device, there are several tools to make 
        backups and restore your information and lastly I can write down a simple tutorial for you to change your Hard Disk...

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        Talking about a good CPU we can mention the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X, one of the best budget CPU by far.
        This CPU has 4 cores and 8 threads, has the power to run very demanding programs and games...


        About Hard Disks we recommend the SK hynix Platinum P41 which is a really affordable M.2 SSD that has 500GB, 1TB, or 2TB of capacity.
        Also the Samsung 870 EVO which is one of the prefered SSD of its type (a SATA SSD)...
