                A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.

                CPU Stands for "Central Processing Unit." The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It  is the brain of the computer. Like a human brain, the CPU controls all the functions of the computer.

                RAM stands for random access memory. RAM is volatile memory, that means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on,
                but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.
                Because of its volatility, RAM can't store permanent data. RAM can be compared to a person's short-term memory, and a hard disk drive to a person's long-term memory. 
                Short-term memory is focused on immediate work, but it can only keep a limited number of facts in view at any one time. When a person's short-term memory fills up,
                it can be refreshed with facts stored in the brain's long-term memory.

                A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the computer's processor must repeatedly go to the hard disk to overlay the old data in RAM with new data. This process slows the computer's operation.

                GPU stands for graphics processing unit, a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing, and gaming applications.
