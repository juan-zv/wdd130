            <p class="home-p">PCs are essentially a machine that makes our lives easier through apps and programs. It allows us to be 
                connected to the web and achieve many things, as scheduling appointments for various services via the web. 
                Computers have an unlimitted library of data and that is knowledge if it is correctly used. Depending on our 
                PC build we can do simple tasks from just surfing the web to shape and share our awesome ideas. Every computer
                is made up of two important things: hardware and software. Hardware is all the physical parts that a computer is
                built from, and is what makes a computer useful. Hardware are the physical components you can touch, and they 
                are located on both the outside and the inside of a computer. These are also the parts that perform all the 
                operations and execute instructions. Software is made up of all the digital parts - the components you cannot 
                see or touch in a computer. Software are collections of programs that tell the hardware components what to do 
                and how to behave. They give the hardware the instructions it needs to execute in order to get things done. 
                Programs are a set of instructions in the form of 0s and 1s (or binary code). They are commands that need to 
                be executed in sequential, logical order. The basic hardware and software of a computer Some of the hardware
                components you can find on the outside of a computer are: The computer case, also known as the tower, which
                contains the important hardware pieces that are found on the inside of a computer. This external physical 
                part stores the internal circuits and digital structures of a computer. Output devices such as: A monitor, 
                which is a screen, used for displaying and outputting visual information. A set of speakers, which translate                     
                digital signals to sound. A printer, which outputs information on pieces of paper. Input devices such as: 
                A keyboard used for typing text and characters – essentially for entering any written information. A mouse for 
                clicking, pointing, and selecting approriate data. A microphone. Some of the most important internal pieces of 
                hardware are mentioned below: The motherboard. It's the main circuit board which connects all the important hardware 
                components together. The CPU (short for Central Processing Unit). Every computer has a CPU. It is also known as a processor 
                and is often referred to as the 'brain' of a computer, since it processes large amounts of information at a high speed. 
                It carries out arithmetic and logical functions. The GPU (short for Graphics Processing Unit). It renders and manipulates 
                images, graphics, videos, and all kinds of visual data. RAM ( short for Random Access Memory), or the main memory. It's a 
                volatile, short-term type of memory that only stores information temporarily while a computer is powered by electricity.
                It is used when you open and are using an application or file. When the power turns off, any files you created or updates 
                you made and didn't save will be lost and are hard to retrieve. HDD (short for Hard Disk Drive) and SSD (short for Solid State Drive),
                are storage devices and are non-volatile. This means that they store and save data permanently, even when the computer is shut 
                down and there is no power supply. A power supply unit. All components require electricity in order to operate and function correctly. 
                The power supply connects to some type of power source, whether it's a power outlet or a battery. Some important software components
                are packages that contain programs for word and number processing and giving presentations such as the Microsoft Office Suite.</p>

                CPU Stands for "Central Processing Unit." The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It  is the brain of the computer. Like a human brain, the CPU controls all the functions of the computer.

                RAM stands for random access memory. RAM is volatile memory, that means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on,
                but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.
                Because of its volatility, RAM can't store permanent data. RAM can be compared to a person's short-term memory, and a hard disk drive to a person's long-term memory. 
                Short-term memory is focused on immediate work, but it can only keep a limited number of facts in view at any one time. When a person's short-term memory fills up,
                it can be refreshed with facts stored in the brain's long-term memory.

                A computer also works this way. If RAM fills up, the computer's processor must repeatedly go to the hard disk to overlay the old data in RAM with new data. This process slows the computer's operation.

                GPU stands for graphics processing unit, a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing, and gaming applications.
